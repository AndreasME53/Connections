These are the following upgrades needed for the Connection program:

1>        Need to re edit Friends Class to confirm the name of each method.
2>        Need to write a README file to explain the program and how to use it.
3>        Need to add the Linear Complexity code for the finding Friends method (the solution is to use a hashMap).


4>        Possibly later i may create a javaFX interface to make it more appealing
